<h2 id="about-course">About Course</h2>
<p>Financial analysis with ChatGPT using pairs is a cutting-edge approach that combines the power of artificial intelligence (AI) with the expertise of financial analysts to provide insights into financial data. ChatGPT and human analysts synergistically foster a collaborative environment that facilitates and generates valuable investment decisions, risk assessments, and financial planning recommendations. Financial analysis with ChatGPT using pairs offers a unique approach to insights from complex financial data.</p>
<p>Through this course, we will use ChatGPT to build a trading bot (using pairs trading) and learn about the capabilities of ChatGPT. The course begins with an introduction to ChatGPT, the project scope, and the course tools required for this course. You will then learn to use the course efficiently and where to get the codes. We will then advance to Pairs trading with ChatGPT. You will learn about pairs trading intuition, the initial prompt, correcting the trading signal, and z-score computation. We will explore returns, log returns, and cumulative returns and test the strategy. You will learn about the long-only strategy and return computation.</p>
<p>Upon completing this course, you will learn the best ways to use ChatGPT to be more efficient and productive with financial decision-making, investments, and trading using pairs trading.</p>
<h2 id="target-audience">Target Audience</h2>
<p>This course is designed for individuals who want to learn to use ChatGPT to build a pairs trading bot or students and professionals in data science and machine learning interested in financial analysis. The prerequisites for the course include a decent understanding of Python and data science libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas), basic knowledge of finance (stock prices, logs, and cumulative returns), and foundational knowledge in Python, finance, and statistics. Please note that the section on Python coding for beginners is not a comprehensive Python coding tutorial per se.</p>
